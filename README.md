# Cosmic Capsules – McMaster Designathon 2026 Submission

This repository contains our submission for the **Cosmic Capsules** Challenge, sponsored by GoEngineer.

## Background
The challenge explores the use of **3D printing and lattice structures** to create sacrificial capsules capable of absorbing impact energy when returning samples from space to Earth.

## Problem
NASA is returning samples from celestial bodies (e.g. Mars, Moon, asteroids).  
These samples must survive re-entry and landing without damage or contamination.

## Challenge Objective
Design a **method for receiving space-returned samples** such that:
- Samples are not damaged
- Samples are not contaminated
- NASA can safely retrieve them after landing

## Constraints
- Samples must remain **fully intact**
- No **breach or cross-contamination**
- **No active propulsion systems**
- **No parachutes** may be used
- Design must be suitable for **rapid prototyping** (24-hour challenge)

## Notes
- 3D-printed parts are for **concept demonstration only**
- Materials and processes are represented conceptually
